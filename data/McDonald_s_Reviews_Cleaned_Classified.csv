Maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store.

It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast.

As mentioned in other reviews here, there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the ""transients"" that call the place ""home"".

I'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.

Unfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with ""rough"" teenagers and ""undesirables"" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The ""rough"" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.

You see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.

I've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.

There are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.

So, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the ""ambiance"" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a ""difficult"" place to eat in given the community.",3 stars,i've numerous time complaint food staff. mentioned review problem overall cleanliness restaurant transient call place home . i'm sure homeless shelter nearby people love hang place always le fortunate people especially morning. morning i've witnessed nypd escort woman restaurant loitering. sign throughout restaurant clearly state loitering 30 min time limit. weather getting colder people looking stay warm. unfortunately mcdonalds difficult position. former general manager fast food restaurant used deal rough teenager undesirable especially night. wanted paying customer friendly warm inviting environment eat families. rough crowd made difficult maintain. like mcds started signs. mcds review also full time security help keep people safe moving. see can't stand door allow people come mcds. best try manage it. give lot credit trying that. also give credit employee deal day long. far cleanliness much better job there. can't speak people given lobby duty i've never seen one cleaning bottle rag clean tables. even sit table morning clean. exactly disgusting clean either. i've never bathroom try avoid costs. i've seen people come also bathroom penn station block. can't pleasant frankly want clean either. mcds area one time convenient me. can't beat price breakfast area nyc. would never bring family there. quick stop morning ok. 3 star environment ambiance cleanliness. food staff great difficult place eat given community.,3,3.0,NY,0

1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

Dine in service was not available. Some of the menu items we wanted were not available Ordered food from the machine, but a staff member said he couldn't find it in the system, started to retype it in the cashier. Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes. When I asked what was going on, he started making rude comments and asked if I spoke English.
I asked for the refund, and the worker refunded me $3 less. Then the manager came, and fixed the refund error. The manager was calm, but didn't offer any apology.

The saddest part is - this is a flagship McDonalds location, advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment. I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere, but it was a huge disappointment.

I wish next time I visit (if ever) to see working services, friendly and competent staff, and adequate food selection.

This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump.

Well, I don't think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service, but...its not changing. My complaint was handled fast and efficient.

Yesterday, I waited an hr because it was raining crazy...for a doordash. They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder.
Today I go, and retrieve my mocha again, and the manager ask me how many were promised to me? I let her know,  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it,  it's taste burnt.  The gm says , I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha. To me...that is calling me a liar. Especially when you repeat it after I tell you ,I didn't come yesterday,  I doordashed and yall messed that up. I also have dash receipts to show.
She then says I didn't call you a liar, but I know I gave you a free one. She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering. No. Have you ever experienced that? I'm here daily!
